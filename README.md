node-paperclip-mock-file-system
=========

This is a npm module that is meant to make testing parts of node-paperclip easier without having to configure a file system and read files all the time.  Maybe this is a good idea, maybe it isn't.

```bash
npm install node-paperclip-mock-file-system --save
```

Here is an example of a model that uses the mongoose plugin.

```javascript
const mongoose     = require('mongoose');
const Schema       = mongoose.Schema;
const Paperclip    = require('node-paperclip');

const ProfileImage = new Schema({
  user_id: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  username: String
});

ProfileImage.plugin(Paperclip.plugins.mongoose, {
  profile_image: {
    avatar: { 
      before_save: [
      
      ],
      styles: [
        { original: true },
        { tiny:     { width: 50,  height: 50,  modifier: '#' } },
        { thumb:    { width: 100, height: 100, modifier: '#' } },
        { profile:  { width: 200, height: 200, modifier: '#' } }
      ],
      prefix:      '{{plural}}/{{document.username}}',
      name_format: '{{style}}.{{extension}}',
      storage: 'mock-file-system'
    }
  }
})

module.exports     = mongoose.model('ProfileImage', ProfileImage);
```
